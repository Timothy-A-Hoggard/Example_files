# Example_files

This directory contains example Rmd documents and the rendered outputs (document pair = Rmd and rendered PDF). I have included three different types of document pairs. 

# Example one
async_analysis_v_2022.Rmd/pdf highlight an analysis pipeline for flow cytometery experiments in lab. 

# Example two
The second type shows a dynamic document written for a lab protocol. 

# Example three
The third type is a collaborative pipeline written for a recently published collaboration (10.1101/gad.349610.122.)
